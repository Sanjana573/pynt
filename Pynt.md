<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>This design document outlines the approach for developing a Python OWASP API scanner tool to generate the OWASP API Top 10 Scan report. The tool will utilize the Pynt API for scanning APIs for potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 id="objective">2. Objective</h2>
<p>The Pynt API focuses on addressing key vulnerabilities outlined in the OWASP API Top 10, including issues like broken object-level authorization, excessive data exposure, injection attacks, and security misconfigurations. By utilizing a context-aware security engine, Pynt conducts proactive API security tests from your local machine, leveraging existing API functional tests to quickly assess and report on your API’s security posture.</p>
<h2 id="scope">3. Scope</h2>
<p>The scope of this project includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Developing a Python-based tool to interact with the Pynt API for scanning APIs.</li>
<li>Identifying OWASP API Top 10 vulnerabilities within scanned APIs using Pynt.</li>
<li>Generating a detailed report containing the mapping between the executed tests and the OWASP API Top 10 vulnerabilities using Pynt.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="target-audience">4. Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience for this tool includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security professionals responsible for assessing API security.</li>
<li>Developers seeking to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in their APIs.</li>
<li>Organizations aiming to enhance their API security posture.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="approach">5. Approach</h2>
<h3 id="tool-selection">Tool Selection</h3>
<p>The tool will leverage the following technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python programming language for development.</li>
<li>Pynt API for API scanning capabilities.</li>
<li>Postman integrated with Pynt for scanning APIs.</li>
<li>GitHub Wiki for documenting the design and usage of the tool.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementation-overview">Implementation Overview</h3>
<p>The implementation of the Python OWASP API scanner tool will involve the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an account and sign in to <a href="http://pynt.io">pynt.io</a>.</li>
<li>Retrieve the API Key from Postman settings.</li>
<li>Select the workspace and collection in Postman.</li>
<li>Open Docker and run Pynt using ‘pynt postman’ command.</li>
<li>Run the Pynt collection in Postman.</li>
<li>Pynt will generate a detailed test report in HTML format, including test case details, status, HTTP requests and responses, assertions, and summary of test results.</li>
<li>The report will also highlight the top 10 OWASP API vulnerabilities detected during the scan, helping you prioritize and address these critical security issues.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">6. Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Python OWASP API scanner tool, leveraging Pynt and integrated with Postman, offers a comprehensive solution for scanning APIs and identifying vulnerabilities. By utilizing Pynt’s context-aware security engine and integrating with Postman for easy API testing, the tool provides security professionals and developers with a powerful means to enhance the security posture of their APIs. The detailed test reports generated by the tool, including mapping to the OWASP API Top 10 vulnerabilities, enable users to prioritize and address critical security issues efficiently. Overall, the tool serves as a valuable asset in improving API security and mitigating potential risks.</p>
